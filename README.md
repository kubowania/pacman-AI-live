# Playable Pacman Game with voice AI commands
Live game of PacMan with voice AI to play.

This is the playable version of the pacman game to go along-side my video tutorial. In the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw), you will learn how to implement Alan A.I voice commands into an existing game of pacman.

This is a great tutorial for those of you wishing to learn about how to envoke functions with voice commands using [Alan A.I](https://alan.app/AniaKubowJavaScriptGames). 

### What you’ll learn
* Implementing Voice Commands into JavaScript Projects
* Setting up SDK Keys
* Understanding Scripts

### Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
* Basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML and CSS is required.
* Understanding of SDK/API Keys.

IMPORTANT: When working with Alan A.I's SDK Keys, please hide your Key and do not publish onto GitHub or share on the internet. This project is for your own local use only and not to be published onto your GitHub with your Key visible to others. You don't want to end up like this [poor person](https://medium.com/@morgannegagne/a-very-expensive-aws-mistake-56a3334ed9ad). This is advise for your own benefit. You can hide your Key by converting this project to use packages such as .dotenv. 

### Who this course is for:
* For beginners wishing to learn about voice command implementation.

When you have finished your project I would love for you to share it with me - you can find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw)  or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ania_kubow).
